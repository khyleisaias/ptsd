# ptsd
A new standard library for programmers that has PTSD with their projects.

# Quick Start
Install with pip:
```console
$ pip3 install libptsd
```
Or manually:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/khyleisaias/ptsd
```
Inside a Python file:
```python3
import libptsd

libptsd.printf("Hello World and Universe and People with PTSD in theit projects.")
```
NOTE: This only works if you are inside the `ptsd/` directory:
```
ptsd/
 |-> ptsd.py
 |-> main.py (Your file, of course)
```
